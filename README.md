## Usage

To use the extension:
**This package requires a valid session token from ChatGPT to access it's unofficial REST API.**
Open the VS Code Command Palette and Type `ChatGPT: Reset token`, this will prompt you for your session token and as of 12/12/2022 you also need a clearance token.

To get the tokens:

1. Go to https://chat.openai.com/chat and log in or sign up (preferably in a browser other then Chrome, see below).
2. Open dev tools.
3. Open `Application` > `Cookies` (`Storage` > `Cookies` on FireFox)

4. Copy the value for `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` & `cl_clearance` and enter it into the prompt from `ChatGPT: Reset token`
5. Go to the `Network` tab and select any request.
6. Copy the value for `user-agent` from the `Request Headers` and enter it into the prompt.

*Once you're logged in, you can ask ChatGPT any question and supply source code from your current file/selection.*

- Because of cloudflare, there are now several limitations, see [here](https://github.com/timkmecl/chatgpt-vscode#update-december-12-2022) for more.
- There are currently users who have issues even when following all of the above (see this [comment](https://github.com/timkmecl/chatgpt-vscode/issues/4#issuecomment-1350562961)). **If you're using Chrome to obtain the tokens, try using a different browser** (e.g. Brave), as it seems like using Chrome is often the cause of this.
